# Session 2: `git` and GitHub

In this session you will learn how to use `git` and GitHub to track changes.

Before doing the exercises in this session, you'll want to tell `git` what your name and email are, so that it creates commits with the appropriate author information. To do that, open a terminal and run the following (it doesn't matter which directory you run these from), but replacing `YOUR NAME` with your name and `YOUR_EMAIL_ADDRESS` with your email address:
```
git config --global user.name "YOUR NAME"
git config --global user.email "YOUR_EMAIL_ADDRESS"
```
